# paper-crawler-for-Sciencemag
The goal of this .py is to automatically download dispersed pdf from some special web sources, in stead of manual mechanical repetition of clicking. That kind of sources, for instance, are Science magazine and Nature.  
**down_scimag.py** is an unfinished library, for currently the only useful function is **down_searchbywebsite()**.  
And a simple example is in **down.py**.
